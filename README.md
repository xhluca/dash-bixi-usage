**Bixi Trips Explorer - One Million Data Points Plotted with Scattergl**

This is a demo of the Dash interactive Python framework developed by [Plotly](https://plot.ly/).

Dash abstracts away all of the technologies and protocols required to build an interactive web-based application and is a simple and effective way to bind a user interface around your Python code.

You can plot up to one million bixi trips sampled from the complete 2017 records, using [Plotly's Scattergl (go.Scatter + WebGL)](https://plot.ly/python/webgl-vs-svg/). 

The data used in this app comes from Bixi [Open Data programme](https://www.bixi.com/en/open-data).
