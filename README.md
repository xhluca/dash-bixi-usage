## Introduction
`dash-app-template` is a repository created to serve as a guideline of what a Dash app's repository should look like. 

In this area, include a brief description of what the application does, and include a link to the [Heroku application](https://dash-tsne.plot.ly/). 

### app_mock.py and app.py

Explain why there is two different versions of the app if necessary. E.g. which app is the heroku version, and local version.

### [Technique/field associated with the instrument]
Give a brief description of the scientific background related to the application that you're interfacing with.

### dash-core 
Include a link to [Dash-Core](https://dash.plot.ly/dash-core-components); describe what it is and what it does.

## Requirements
Here you should include details of the Python version required to control your app; any packages; any requirements of the file structure; and the commands to run that will set up your app and get it ready to run.

## How to use the app
Here, you should put the command needed to run your app, and then the steps that the user should take to use it. You should include screenshots of the app running in your own browser to make it easier to follow along. 

Then, show a step-by-step guide of how your app works, and what each control does.

If possible, include screenshots of something in the app failing, and, if any, the steps that the user can take to correct the error. 

### Controls
Here, provide a list of all of your controls and a description of what they do.


## Resources
If necessary, include resources like documentation for your app, or the pages associated with any external packages used in the project.
